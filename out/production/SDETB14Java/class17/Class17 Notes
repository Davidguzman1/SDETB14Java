Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that control the access of methods fields or the class itself
    There are 4 levels of access
Private:
    If something has the access level of private that thing can only be accessed within the same class
    this access level is the most restricted one. for fields/properties/state of a class we should always try to have private access so that
    the data of the class is secured
Default:
    Default is not a keyword it is an access level if we don't use any keyword with fields or methods java applies the default access level automatically
    once applied we can access those entities within the same class as well as in any class within the same package
Protected:
    When applied entities can be accessed outside of the package as well but only in the class that have parent-child relationship
Public:
    When the public access modifier is applied to an entity that entity can be accessed anywhere inside that project
    Usually the classes itself and methods are declared as public
Note:
if we are inside the same class we can call a method inside another by just writing its name. But we
need to take care that these methods are both either static or non-static
