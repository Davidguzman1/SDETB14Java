Method Overriding:
    Allows us to have same name methods in parent/child classes
Why we should Override a method:
    Lets say we are inheriting from a Parent class that has 10 methods. We like 8 of them and we ant to reuse those
    methods but we don't like to 2 of them we want to provide implementation in a different way
    We can use method overriding to override those 2 methods
What is the syntax to override a method:
    We simply redefine the method in the child class
