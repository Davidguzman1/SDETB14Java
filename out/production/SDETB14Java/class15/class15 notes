How Java code is compiled/executed on a computer
    we write the code in files with extension ,java
    once we hit the run button a software program called compiler
    checks the code for errors
    and covert it to byte code
    JVM another software program further converts this code to binary code
    and this binary code is what is exclude on your computers
Methods in Java:
    Method is a block of code or some java statements grouped together
Why we should learn about methods
    Methods help us reduce the amount of code that we have to write
    for example if a piece of code is being repeated again and again we can create a method for it and smiple
    call that method whenever we need that logic again
Syntax of creating a method:
    we can create methods only inside a class
    [datatype] [method name] [(datatype var name)][method body]
    [datatype] can be void boolean String int etc.
    [method name] are like var names
    [(datatype var name)]
How do we decide that should use void or a method with a return keyword
    if we are building a method that will be used by others or in other parts of your code which
    require some data from your method like an if condition we should not create methods with void type
Types of variables with respect to their scope
    There are three types if variables w.r.t their scope
    local Variables- a variable that is created inside method loop switch case or any block of code is called local variable
    for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
    System.out.println(i);
    }
    intsance Variables- Which are declared outside a block of code but inside a class are called intsance variables
    static Variables-if an instance variable has a keyword static with it it is called a static variable

When we should use local var:
    local variables occupy the computers memory for the shortest amount of time We should always go with local var
    if it is possible
When we should use instance variables:
    When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class or we ant to share something in multiple
    variables
    Downsides are they keep on occupy the memory for longer as compared to local variables
When to use Static variable:
    When we need to share something across the objects we use static
    Downside are it occupies the memory for the longest amount of time
