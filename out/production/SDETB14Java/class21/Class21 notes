Method overloading:
    Allows us to have same name methods or constructor but with different parameters
Why we should  use method overloading:
    It gives the flexibility to the end user that he can use the same method in many different ways
    It helps us write cleaner code
What is the syntax to overload a Method:
    Create different Methods but keep the following points in mind
    1.We can overload a method by just passing different number of parameters
    2.We can overload a method by changing the data type of the parameter
    3.we can overload a method by changing the sequence
