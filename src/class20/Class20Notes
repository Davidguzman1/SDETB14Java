What is inheritance:
    It's a mechanism through which a class can inhabit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should learn inheritance:
    it helps avoid code duplication.
    it helps us save space
    it helps us improve execution speed
What is the syntax:
    We use the extends keyword and the name of the class which we want to inherit the fields and methods while
    declaring the class
Types of inheritance:
    There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 in classes
    1.Single inheritance
    2.Multilevel inheritance
    3.Hierarchical Inheritance
    4.Multiple inheritance(Not Supported by classes in java)
Single Inheritance:
    When we have only one parent and one child class in inheritance it is called single inheritance
    not widely used.
MultiLevel Inheritance:
    One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes
    For example A<B<C<D
Hierarchical Inheritance:
    When there is a one parent class and multiple child classes
Multiple inheritance:
    One Child and multiple parent classes and it is not supported by java classes
    It creates the diamond problem
Super Keyword:
    We use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class when we have same
    name instance variables in child class.
    We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class

Method Overloading:
    Method overloading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with the same name.
Why we should create multiple methods with same name
    It gives the end user flexibility
    The end user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different results
How do we Overload a method:
    1.By passing different number of parameters
    2.By changing the Data type
    3.By changing the sequence of parameters
