Method overloading:
    Allows us to have same name methods or constructor but with different parameters
    It doesn't allow us to change just the return type for the overloaded method

Why we should  use method overloading:
    It gives the flexibility to the end user that he can use the same method in many different ways
    It helps us write cleaner code
What is the syntax to overload a Method:
    Create different Methods but keep the following points in mind
    1.We can overload a method by just passing different number of parameters
    2.We can overload a method by changing the data type of the parameter
    3.we can overload a method by changing the sequence
